roadburnCalendarApp
===================

Here is a little print-friendly calendar app based on Angular.js to view all shows from Roadburn 2013.

Want to contribute?
-------------------

I used Yeoman to build the app.

Yeoman installation (requires Node.js):

``npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower ``

Then clone the repo, and install the default dependencies:

``npm install && bower install``

You can launch a development webserver with grunt:

``grunt server``

Want to host the app on your server? Build it with grunt:

``grunt build --force``
